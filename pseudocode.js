//array would start empty
//you would click a button
//and that button would push whatever value into that array as a string
//add a space to the right of the number
//show each number in display box as a string until clear is pressed
//entries needs to display as concatinated string


//once equals is pressed
//it takes that array puts it into eval function
//this will mean we need to make the number buttons string values into number values 
//we take the result of that eval function and put it into a variable
//then we take that variable and output it into display
